# ARC Raiders Loot Recycler

A lightweight React + TypeScript single-page app to manage ARC Raiders loot. It loads the latest items from the MetaForge community API (cached locally), merges your French aliases and Recycling Cheat Sheet preferences, and lets you classify each item as KEEP, MAYBE, or RECYCLE with instant filtering.

Item data provided by [MetaForge](https://metaforge.app/arc-raiders). Recycling categories come from the community "ARC Raiders Recycling Cheat Sheet".

## Features

- Cached `data/items-base.json` populated via MetaForge API (no runtime API calls)
- Merge-in support for manual French names/aliases and cheat sheet guidance
- Search normalizes English/French names plus aliases with accent tolerance
- Filters by category, rarity, user status, and guide category (+ quick presets)
- LocalStorage persistence of KEEP/MAYBE/RECYCLE selections with conflict hints
- Simple FR/EN toggle for the interface labels

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run update:items   # fetches latest items JSON via MetaForge API
npm run update:french  # imports official French names from ARC Tracker
npm run update:guide   # parses the GameRant article for guide classifications
npm run dev            # start Vite dev server
```

Open the printed localhost URL (defaults to `http://localhost:5173`).

> If you see a warning that `data/items-base.json` is missing, run `npm run update:items` first.

## Building for production

```bash
npm run build   # type-check + Vite build -> dist/
npm run start   # serves the production build (alias of vite preview --host)
```

Deploy the contents of `dist/` to any static host or serve with a simple HTTP server on your VPS.

## Refreshing item data

The project ships with two helper scripts:

- `scripts/update-items.js` downloads the entire MetaForge `/items` catalog (all pages) and saves it to `data/items-base.json`.
- `scripts/update-french-aliases.js` calls the [ARC Tracker](https://arctracker.io/fr/items) API and merges all French item names into `data/item-aliases.json` so searches work with FR queries.
- `scripts/update-guide-from-gamerant.js` fetches the [GameRant safe-to-sell article](https://gamerant.com/arc-raiders-which-item-safe-sell-should-you-recycle-guide-list/), parses the big table, and converts it into guide metadata.

```
npm run update:items   # refresh MetaForge data
npm run update:french  # refresh official French names
npm run update:guide   # refresh guide metadata from GameRant
```

Commit the updated JSON if you want the new data bundled with the app, then rebuild.

## Customizable data files

All JSON lives in the `data/` folder:

- `items-base.json` – raw response from the MetaForge items endpoint (managed by the update script).
- `item-aliases.json` – map keyed by item `id` where `npm run update:french` stores `name_fr` entries from ARC Tracker; you can still extend each entry with your own `aliases`.
- `french-dictionary.json` – lightweight English→French dictionary used to auto-generate French tokens from the English names. Extend this list with your own words or multi-word entries so the search finds items when you type their French name (the UI still displays English).
- `guide-cheatsheet.json` – generated by the GameRant scraper. Each entry stores the derived `guideCategory`, optional `stations`, list of quests, what the article says about when to sell, plus the recycle breakdown/sell price pulled from the table. You can manually edit individual entries if you disagree with the parser.

When the app boots it merges everything. Any item not present in `guide-cheatsheet.json` defaults to `guideCategory = "NONE"`.

## User preferences & persistence

Because this is a pure static SPA, per-item KEEP/MAYBE/RECYCLE selections are stored in `localStorage` under the key `arcraiders:user-statuses`. Clearing browser storage resets your selections. If you ever expand to a backend, mirror the same structure server-side to keep compatibility.

## Linting

`npm run lint` runs ESLint (flat config) across the project. Vite/TypeScript strict settings are enabled for safer refactors.
